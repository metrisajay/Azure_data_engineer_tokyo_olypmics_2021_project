I'm thrilled to share a recent data engineering project I've been working on, revolving around the Tokyo Olympics dataset! 🏅

In this project, leveraged the power of Azure Data Factory for Data Ingestion, Azure Data Lake Gen2 for Datalake, Azure Databricks for processing the transformation, and Azure Key Vault for securely accessing the data from Datalake within the Notebook.

🔑 Learnings from this project.
✅ How to Fetch the Data from the API
✅ Building Data Lake using Azure Data Lake Gen 2
✅ Building Data Pipeline using Azure Data Factory
✅ Secure the secrets/credentials using Azure Key Vault
✅ Data Transformation using Azure Databricks
✅ Data Analysis using SQL on Synapse Analytics

 🌐Azure Data Factory
Data Ingestion service that enables you to create, schedule and manage data pipelines in efficient data movement and transformation between various sources and destinations in Azure and beyond. It simplifies ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) and Data Ingestion tasks.

🌐Azure Data Lake
Data lake solution that combines the capabilities of a data lake with the power of Azure Blob Storage, allowing you to store and analyze large volumes of structured and unstructured data with enhanced performance, security and analytics capabilities.

🌐Azure Databricks
Databricks is a unified analytics platform built on top of Apache Spark, designed to help data engineers and data scientists collaborate on big data processing and machine learning tasks. It provides tools for data exploration, data processing, and building machine learning models in a collaborative and scalable environment.

🌐Azure Synapse Analytics
SQL Data Warehouse is a cloud-based analytics service provided by Microsoft Azure. It combines big data and data warehousing into a single integrated platform, allowing organizations to analyze and process large volumes of data for business intelligence and data analytics purposes.

Special thanks to Darshil Parmar for the project idea and guidance.
